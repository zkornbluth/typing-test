# Typing Speed Test
Run and use this to test your typing speed and accuracy.

## Getting Started

### 1. Ensure you have the following installed:
* Git
* node.js
* npm (Node Package Manager)

### 2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zkornbluth/typing-test.git
cd typing-test
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run

Your console should display a URL that looks like this: [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000). Copy and paste that URL into a browser. 
Don't use the link here as your port may be different.
